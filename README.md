There are the discription of my LabVIEW code for intrest:

1.Bundle:Select a cluster constant ,then it can creat a bundler by name and wires the constant and origan terminal to the bundler.If you select the contral terminal or property node at the same time,it will connect them to the bundler by name or top of position sorting.Emmmmm,Why i donâ€˜t put in local varable? because of sogou pingying!
2.Write Property:it is easy~
